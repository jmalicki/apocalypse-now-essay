\label{sec:vi-modern-psychology-and-death}

Where theological traditions (Section III) locate punishment in divine judgment and Buddhist 
causality, where philosophy (Section IV) finds it in the will's metaphysical structure, and 
where critical theory (Section V) historicizes it within colonial institutions, depth 
psychology reveals another layer: desire is a defense against death. From 
Freud's death drive to Becker's immortality projects, modern psychology repeatedly argues that 
what we ``want'' is symbolic mastery over mortality. Fulfillment punishes because it exposes 
the defense as futile. The mission cannot still the terror it was meant to mask.
