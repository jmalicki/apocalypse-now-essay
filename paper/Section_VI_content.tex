\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{VI. Modern Psychology and Death}
\label{sec:vi-modern-psychology-and-death}

Where theological traditions (Section III) locate punishment in divine judgment and Buddhist
causality, where philosophy (Section IV) finds it in the will's metaphysical structure, and
where critical theory (Section V) historicizes it within colonial institutions, depth
psychology reveals another layer: desire is a defense against death. From
Freud's death drive to Becker's immortality projects, modern psychology repeatedly argues that
what we ``want'' is symbolic mastery over mortality. Fulfillment punishes because it exposes
the defense as futile. The mission cannot still the terror it was meant to mask.
