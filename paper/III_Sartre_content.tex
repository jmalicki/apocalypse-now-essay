\subsection*{III—Sartre: Freedom, Bad Faith, and the Impossible Completion}
\label{ssec:iii-sartre}
For Sartre, human reality is “what it is not and not what it is” (\parencite[pp.~100--110]{SartreBN2003}); projects tacitly aim at an impossible synthesis—the “project to be God” (\parencite[pp.~586--604]{SartreBN2003}). Completion cannot grant ontological closure; it exposes bad faith, whether as pure function (“I am my orders”) or as sovereign exception (“I am exempt”). The mission’s end therefore punishes by lucidity: the sequence “worked,” yet the lack constitutive of the \emph{pour-soi} remains.
