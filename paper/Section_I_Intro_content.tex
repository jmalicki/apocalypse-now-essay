When Captain Willard opens \textit{Apocalypse Now} (1979) with the line, ``Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one,'' he states a moral law. Beneath the soldier’s irony lies a metaphysical claim: that desire fulfilled is inseparable from punishment. The first clause universalizes fulfillment as an inevitable structure; the second localizes it as judgment. This essay traces that paradox across traditions: biblical justice and Buddhist causality; Western philosophy’s metaphysics of will; Conrad’s colonial modernity refracted through Coppola; and modern psychology’s confrontation with mortality. Willard’s line, stripped of theology but charged with fatalism, speaks for the modern self: one who always gets what he wants—and must live with what it means.
