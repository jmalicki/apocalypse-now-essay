\subsubsection*{Weber: The Iron Cage and Vocation Without Grace}
Max Weber's \textit{The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism} (1905) diagnoses 
modernity's core pathology: the transformation of religious calling into secular compulsion. 
Calvinist anxiety over predestination drove believers to seek worldly success as evidence of 
election, but success never settled the question---it only demanded more proof 
\parencite{WeberProtestant2002}. Eventually, the theological frame collapsed, leaving an ``iron 
cage'' of rationalized labor, bureaucratic hierarchy, and instrumental discipline that no 
longer serves transcendent ends but persists through its own momentum 
\parencite{WeberProtestant2002}. Weber's warning is stark: modern subjects become ``specialists 
without spirit, sensualists without heart,'' trapped in systems they did not choose and cannot 
escape.

Willard's mission arrives as pure vocation-form minus vocation-content. He ``wanted a 
mission''---orientation, purpose, relief from drift---and the bureaucracy supplies exactly 
that: typed orders, dossiers, a clear objective. But the mission cannot answer \emph{why} this 
task, for whom, toward what end beyond its own completion. The system assumes its own 
legitimacy. To ``get what one wants'' here is to receive the cage as gift: structure without 
meaning, discipline without grace. ``For my sins they gave me one'' registers the trap: the 
very clarity of the assignment reveals that one has internalized the rationalization.

Weber's concept of the ``routinization of charisma'' further illuminates Kurtz's trajectory 
\parencite{WeberProtestant2002}. Charismatic authority (personal, revolutionary) cannot sustain 
itself; it either dissolves or hardens into bureaucratic routine. Kurtz begins as the 
exemplary officer, embodying institutional ideals, but his methods become ``unsound''---too 
honest, too direct. The mission to eliminate him is bureaucracy protecting itself from its own 
charismatic truth. When Willard completes it, he performs the routinization: the dangerous 
personal will is neutralized, and order is restored. Getting what the institution wanted 
exposes the will as functionary.

\subsubsection*{Arendt: The Banality of Evil and Dispersed Agency}
Hannah Arendt's \textit{Eichmann in Jerusalem} (1963) reveals a more chilling structure: 
totalitarian evil does not require monsters, only clerks. Adolf Eichmann organized mass murder 
not from sadistic passion but from bureaucratic diligence; he ``never realized what he was 
doing'' because his role fragmented responsibility into procedural compliance 
\parencite{ArendtEichmann1963}. Arendt calls this the ``banality of evil'': systems generate 
catastrophic outcomes that no single agent intends, yet which implicate every participant. The 
desk worker signing forms, the train conductor, the accountant---all fulfill their roles, and 
the totality produces death.

Willard occupies this structure perfectly. He is an ``errand boy sent by grocery clerks,'' as 
Kurtz sneers---a functionary in a dispersed system where no one person authors the violence, 
yet everyone enables it. The briefing room officers are polite, rational, sanitized; the 
mission is ``surgical.'' Yet the cumulative result is a trail of destruction upriver. Arendt's 
analysis clarifies why Willard's tone is so affectless: to think \emph{within} the role is to 
think procedurally, and procedural thought cannot access the moral question. The agent becomes 
``thoughtless'' not from stupidity but from the narrowing of attention to the task 
\parencite{ArendtEichmann1963}.

Arendt also distinguishes labor, work, and action \parencite{ArendtHC1958}. Action alone 
discloses ``who'' one is through speech and deed among equals; labor and work are instrumental. 
The mission-form converts what should be action (a choice about how to live) into work (a 
problem to solve). ``Everyone gets everything he wants'' here means: the system reliably 
delivers instrumental success. ``For my sins I got one'' means: instrumental success is not the 
disclosure of who I am but the erasure of the question. The will wanted to act and received a 
procedure instead.

When Willard reaches Kurtz, he confronts not an alternative to bureaucracy but its 
symptom---the figure who tried to escape the iron cage by absolutizing personal will and 
discovered that absolute will, severed from any plurality of equals, is indistinguishable from 
tyranny. Both paths (bureaucratic compliance and charismatic sovereignty) fulfill desire by 
revealing its complicity. In Arendt's terms, neither path preserves the space of action; both 
reduce persons to functions. Fulfillment punishes because the structure that delivers what one 
wants is precisely the structure that makes wanting ethically void.
