\label{sec:iii-biblical-justice-and-buddhist-causality}

Captain Willard's aphorism---``Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for
my sins they gave me one''---condenses a structure shared across religious philosophies:
\emph{fulfillment discloses the truth of desire}. In the Biblical tradition (Hebrew Scripture
and Christian New Testament), that disclosure is moral and teleological: a will shows itself to
be
rightly or wrongly ordered toward God and neighbor. In early Buddhist analysis, the disclosure
is causal and phenomenological: craving (\emph{taṇhā}) reproduces the conditions of suffering
(\emph{dukkha}). Biblical thought reads fulfillment as a test of love's orientation; Buddhist
thought reads it as a link in a causal chain. In both, the ``gift'' of what one wants becomes
judgment---not because an external agent inflicts pain, but because the will's orientation or
the mind's grasping makes the pain intrinsic to fulfillment itself.
