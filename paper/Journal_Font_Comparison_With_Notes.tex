\newcommand{\sampletext}{When Captain Willard opens \textit{Apocalypse Now} (1979) with the line, ``Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one,'' he states a moral law. Beneath the soldierâ€™s irony lies a metaphysical claim: that desire fulfilled is inseparable from punishment. The first clause universalizes fulfillment as an inevitable structure; the second localizes it as judgment.}

% -------- Serif families (bookish / humanities) --------
\section*{Serif Families (Humanities / Philosophy / Theology)}

\tryfontwithnote
{EB Garamond}
{EB Garamond}
{A classic old-style serif frequently associated with humanities journals and monographs. Excellent italics and readable text color.
	\textbf{Use if you want the vibe of:} philosophy/theology, literary studies, film theory.
	\textbf{Comparable publisher faces:} Adobe Garamond, Bembo, Minion Pro.}

\tryfontwithnote
{Libertinus Serif}
{Libertinus Serif}
{A modern, highly readable book face derived from Linux Libertine with better math/diacritics support.
	\textbf{Great for:} serious humanities \& philosophy manuscripts that may include diacritics, Greek, or occasional math.
	Pairs well with Libertinus Sans for captions.

\tryfontwithnote
{TeX Gyre Termes (Times-like)}
{TeX Gyre Termes}
{A robust, free ``Times'' variant.
	\textbf{Great for:} APA-style manuscripts and general submissions where journals ask for Times New Roman 12pt but you want TeX quality.
	\textbf{Vibe:} mainstream journal production PDFs (Elsevier/Springer often look Times-ish).}

\tryfontwithnote
{TeX Gyre Pagella (Palatino-like)}
{TeX Gyre Pagella}
{A friendlier, wider Palatino-like face with soft page color for long reading.
	\textbf{Great for:} long humanities essays and book chapters. Palatino/Pagella can feel more approachable than Times.
	\textbf{Vibe:} graceful, classic essays and some university press books.}

\tryfontwithnote
{TeX Gyre Schola (Century Schoolbook-like)}
{TeX Gyre Schola}
{A sturdy, schoolbook-inspired serif with generous x-height.

{A widely available, neutral serif.
	\textbf{Great for:} portability and guaranteed rendering across platforms.

% -------- Sans families (modern / clean) --------
\section*{Sans-Serif Families (APA / Social Science / Contemporary Look)}

\tryfontwithnote
{Libertinus Sans}
{Libertinus Sans}
{Pairs with Libertinus Serif. Clean without being sterile.
	\textbf{Great for:} figure labels, tables, and captions; ACM-ish submissions when paired with Libertinus Serif.
	\textbf{Vibe:} modern scholarly tech.}

\tryfontwithnote
{TeX Gyre Heros (Helvetica-like)}
{TeX Gyre Heros}
{A Helvetica/Arial style sans.
	\textbf{Great for:} APA 7 acceptable sans look (when journals allow sans for manuscripts); posters, slides, tables.
	\textbf{Vibe:} neutral, polished.}

\tryfontwithnote
{DejaVu Sans}
{DejaVu Sans}
{A very common sans-serif with strong Unicode coverage.
	\textbf{Great for:} international characters and robust PDF portability.

% -------- Monospaced (code / appendices / apparatus) --------
\section*{Monospaced (Appendices / Code / Typewriter Look)}

\tryfontwithnote
{DejaVu Sans Mono}
{DejaVu Sans Mono}
{A clear monospaced face for code samples and apparatus.
	\textbf{Great for:} appendices, quoted code, or aligned text.
	\textbf{Vibe:} precise and technical.}

\tryfontwithnote
{Libertinus Mono}

	\textbf{Vibe:} cohesive family look.}

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Guidance:} For a \emph{humanities/philosophy} paper like yours, choose \textbf{EB Garamond} or \textbf{Libertinus Serif} for the body.
For APA-style submissions, \textbf{TeX Gyre Termes} gives you a Times-like look with better TeX rendering.
If you plan to submit to ACM-style venues later, \textbf{Libertinus Serif + Libertinus Sans} is a strong, journal-adjacent pairing.
