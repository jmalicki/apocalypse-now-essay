\subsection*{III—Dostoevsky: Independent Desire and Anti-Mechanism}
\label{ssec:iii-dostoevsky}
The Underground Man insists “man only wants independent desire,” refusing to be a “piano key” in a rational program (\parencite[pp.~115, 129--131]{DostoevskyNFU1994}). The dossier-machine is the nightmare: an apparatus that \emph{delivers} missions and interprets obedience as authorship. The line’s two halves catch the trap: the system supplies occasions to act (“everyone gets …”), and the agent, having sought agency \emph{as such}, discovers in success only the mirror of compulsion. Mission-success reveals heteronomy in the form of efficacy.
