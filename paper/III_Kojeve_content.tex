\subsection*{III—Koj\`eve: Desire of Desire and Historical Stakes}
\label{ssec:iii-kojeve}
Human desire is the desire of another’s desire; satisfaction requires being recognized as free by a free other, not merely possessing objects (\parencite[pp.~6, 27--34]{KojeveIRH1980}). Hence the master’s “victory” is empty: coerced recognition is not recognition (\parencite[pp.~158--164]{KojeveIRH1980}). “Everyone gets everything he wants” marks an apparatus expert at distributing missions; “…and for my sins I got one” is the discovery that such distribution cannot secure the recognitive relation the human wants.
