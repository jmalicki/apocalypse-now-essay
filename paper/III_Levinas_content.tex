\subsection*{III—Levinas: The Face, Asymmetry, and the First Relation}
\label{ssec:iii-levinas}
The face confronts me with an asymmetrical injunction—“Thou shalt not kill”—that resists absorption into my plans (\parencite[pp.~33, 199]{LevinasTI1969}). The dossier/protocol grammar belongs to \emph{totality}, which reduces alterity to the Same (\parencite[pp.~21--24, 33--36]{LevinasTI1969}). Within such a grammar, even successful action confirms refusal of the first relation (\parencite[pp.~215--219]{LevinasTI1969}). “Everyone gets …” states totality’s power to furnish effects; “…for my sins I got one” is the accusation that such power presupposes the Other’s reduction.
