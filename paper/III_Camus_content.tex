\subsection*{III—Camus: Absurd Lucidity and Action without Appeal}
\label{ssec:iii-camus}
The absurd is “born of the confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world” (\parencite[p.~28]{CamusSisyphus1991}). To live “without appeal” (\parencite[p.~54]{CamusSisyphus1991}) is to abandon the hope that completion provides a final court of justification. The Do Lung Bridge cycle—building and erasure—reads like a Sisyphean figure; completion yields knowledge, not meaning (\parencite[pp.~121--123]{CamusSisyphus1991}). Thus the sentence’s first clause can be true; the second names fulfillment as the world’s silence.
