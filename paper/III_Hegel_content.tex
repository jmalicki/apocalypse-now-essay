\subsection*{III—Hegel: Recognition Against Possession}
\label{ssec:iii-hegel}
Desire is not finally of things but of recognition: “self-consciousness achieves its satisfaction only in another self-consciousness” (\parencite[\S175]{HegelPhenomenology1977}). Lordship “gets” obedience and finds it void—submission is not free acknowledgment (\parencite[\S\S187--189]{HegelPhenomenology1977}); the “truth” lies with formative work that builds a common world (\parencite[\S196]{HegelPhenomenology1977}). The first clause describes accumulation in the wrong currency; the second is the recognitive bill coming due.
