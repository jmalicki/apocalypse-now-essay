\label{ssec:vi-zizek}

Slavoj {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek, working within Lacan's framework, extends psychoanalytic theory into
ideology critique. His central insight is that ideology does not function primarily through
false beliefs but through fantasy structures that organize desire. In \textit{The Sublime
	Object of Ideology} (1989), he argues that the formula of ideology is not ``they do not know
what they are doing'' but rather ``they know very well what they are doing, but still, they
are doing it'' \parencite[p.~32]{ZizekSublime1999}. Cynical reason is not the opposite of
ideology but its perfected form: the subject disavows belief at the level of knowledge while
maintaining it at the level of practice.

Applied to Willard's confession, this explains the peculiar doubled consciousness of the line.
Willard \emph{knows} the mission is absurd, that Kurtz is the empire's truth-teller rather
than its aberration, that assassination will not restore moral order. His narration is cynical,
distanced, lucid. Yet \emph{still} he proceeds. The fantasy is not that the mission is just;
the fantasy is that completing it will deliver him from the unbearable burden of having to
decide for himself what to do. {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek calls this ``interpassivity''---the subject
outsources belief to the Other (the institution, the dossier, the orders) so he can act
without being responsible for the act's meaning \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}.

{\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek also theorizes the role of the \emph{big Other} in sustaining symbolic
order. The big Other is not a person but the symbolic structure itself---the presumed place
from which our acts acquire meaning \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. When Willard says ``for my
sins they gave me one,'' the ``they'' is the big Other: the military, the state, the mission's
authority. The tragedy is not that the big Other commands wrongly, but that the big Other does
not exist---it is a fiction we maintain through collective performance. Yet the subject acts
\emph{as if} it exists, and this ``as if'' sustains the entire structure of obedience.

The concept of \emph{enjoyment} (\emph{jouissance}) further clarifies why fulfillment
punishes. {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek, following Lacan, insists that the subject does not simply want
pleasure; it wants a certain kind of suffering, a specific way of failing, because that failure
confirms its identity \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. The neurotic does not want to be cured; he
wants to continue suffering in the mode that secures his subjectivity. Willard's repetition
compulsion (wanting another mission despite knowing missions do not satisfy) is not a mistake;
it is a defense. Getting the mission allows him to continue being the subject-who-completes-missions,
even when completion reveals the role as empty. The punishment is not external; it is the
jouissance of remaining trapped.

Finally, {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek's analysis of traversing the fantasy involves recognizing that
there is no big Other who will redeem your acts, no hidden meaning behind the mission's horror
\parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. The subject must accept that the symbolic order is groundless
and still act. Willard's final silence---his refusal to narrate what the killing meant---could
be read as a failed traversal. He has seen through the fantasy (the mission will not complete
him), but he has not changed his relation to it. He remains within the structure, awaiting the
next assignment. ``Everyone gets everything he wants'' is true at the level of fantasy (the
institution delivers); ``for my sins I got one'' is the knowledge that the fantasy persists
despite the knowledge.
