\label{ssec:vi-zizek}

Slavoj {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek, working within Lacan's framework, extends psychoanalytic theory into 
ideology critique. His central insight is that ideology does not function primarily through 
false beliefs but through fantasy structures that organize desire. In \textit{The Sublime 
Object of Ideology} (1989), he argues that the formula of ideology is not ``they do not know 
what they are doing'' but rather ``they know very well what they are doing, but still, they 
are doing it'' \parencite[p.~32]{ZizekSublime1999}. Cynical reason is not the opposite of 
ideology but its perfected form: the subject disavows belief at the level of knowledge while 
maintaining it at the level of practice.

Applied to Willard's confession, this explains the peculiar doubled consciousness of the line. 
Willard \emph{knows} the mission is absurd, that Kurtz is the empire's truth-teller rather 
than its aberration, that assassination will not restore moral order. His narration is cynical, 
distanced, lucid. Yet \emph{still} he proceeds. The fantasy is not that the mission is just; 
the fantasy is that completing it will deliver him from the unbearable burden of having to 
decide for himself what to do. {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek calls this ``interpassivity''---the subject 
outsources belief to the Other (the institution, the dossier, the orders) so he can act 
without being responsible for the act's meaning \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}.

{\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek also theorizes the role of the \emph{big Other} in sustaining symbolic 
order. The big Other is not a person but the symbolic structure itself---the presumed place 
from which our acts acquire meaning \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. When Willard says ``for my 
sins they gave me one,'' the ``they'' is the big Other: the military, the state, the mission's 
authority. The tragedy is not that the big Other commands wrongly, but that the big Other does 
not exist---it is a fiction we maintain through collective performance. Yet the subject acts 
\emph{as if} it exists, and this ``as if'' sustains the entire structure of obedience.

The concept of \emph{enjoyment} (\emph{jouissance}) further clarifies why fulfillment 
punishes. {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek, following Lacan, insists that the subject does not simply want 
pleasure; it wants a certain kind of suffering, a specific way of failing, because that failure 
confirms its identity \parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. The neurotic does not want to be cured; he 
wants to continue suffering in the mode that secures his subjectivity. Willard's repetition 
compulsion (wanting another mission despite knowing missions do not satisfy) is not a mistake; 
it is a defense. Getting the mission allows him to continue being the subject-who-completes-missions, 
even when completion reveals the role as empty. The punishment is not external; it is the 
jouissance of remaining trapped.

Finally, {\v{Z}}i{\v{z}}ek's analysis of traversing the fantasy involves recognizing that 
there is no big Other who will redeem your acts, no hidden meaning behind the mission's horror 
\parencite{ZizekSublime1999}. The subject must accept that the symbolic order is groundless 
and still act. Willard's final silence---his refusal to narrate what the killing meant---could 
be read as a failed traversal. He has seen through the fantasy (the mission will not complete 
him), but he has not changed his relation to it. He remains within the structure, awaiting the 
next assignment. ``Everyone gets everything he wants'' is true at the level of fantasy (the 
institution delivers); ``for my sins I got one'' is the knowledge that the fantasy persists 
despite the knowledge.
