\label{sec:v-colonial-modernity}

If the preceding sections traced desire's structure through theological, philosophical, and 
psychological lenses, this section historicizes that structure within modernity's institutions 
of power. Twentieth-century critical theory shows how the will's metabolism---wanting, getting, 
being exposed---is not timeless but shaped by colonialism, bureaucracy, and technologies of 
representation. From Weber's iron cage to Fanon's colonial violence, each thinker reveals how 
``getting what one wants'' under modernity often means internalizing the very domination one 
sought to escape. Willard's line becomes a diagnosis of historical complicity, not just 
existential condition.
