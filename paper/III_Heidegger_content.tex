\subsection*{III—Heidegger: Finitude and the Category Error of Wholeness}
\label{ssec:iii-heidegger}
Heidegger’s claim is ontological: Dasein’s “wholeness” is disclosed only in being-toward-death; narrative consummation is a category mistake for finite existence (\parencite[pp.~294--307]{HeideggerBT1962}). Average everydayness (\emph{das Man}) supplies the rhetoric of necessity that authorizes such fantasies (\parencite[pp.~149--168]{HeideggerBT1962}). When the sequence “works,” the alibi disappears. The first clause names a world of operable equipment; the second registers, in the key of finitude, that such operability cannot yield existential completion.
