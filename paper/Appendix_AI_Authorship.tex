Other than this appendix, the essay is entirely written by AI. It started as a question to
figure out the meaning of Willard's line, however it seemed the answer could be complicated
and was approaching an essay, so the human author went forward with asking the AI to expand
it. The human author acted mostly like a teacher---I gave the essay prompt and topic, worked
with the AI student on developing an outline, and kept sending it back with criticism and
requests for revisions. The human author has not ever read a slight majority of the works
cited, but is hopeful that asking for specific quotes and citations to actual page numbers in
actual works is keeping AI a bit more honest, and I am comforted that the explanations
regarding works I am familiar with seem to be reasonable. The full OpenAI interaction log and
Cursor interaction logs are in the accompanying

	repository}, where you can see the work that the human author did to produce the essay.
