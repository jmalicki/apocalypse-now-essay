\label{ssec:v-adorno-horkheimer}
Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer's \textit{Dialectic of Enlightenment} (1944) traces the
Enlightenment's fatal reversal: the project to liberate humanity from myth through reason
becomes a new form of domination. Reason, they argue, degrades into \emph{instrumental
	reason}---a logic that reduces all things to calculable means for given ends, with no capacity
to evaluate the ends themselves \parencite{AdornoHorkheimer2002}. Nature is mastered through
science, but the same logic is turned on human beings: society becomes a machine for
processing persons as inputs. The result is what they call the ``totally administered world,''
where freedom is marketed as choice among pre-determined options.

The briefing scene in \textit{Apocalypse Now} epitomizes this structure. Kurtz is presented as
a technical problem requiring a calculated solution. The language is sanitized: ``terminate
with extreme prejudice.'' No one deliberates whether assassination is the right \emph{kind} of
response; instrumental reason has already framed the question as ``how to eliminate
efficiently.'' Willard receives maps, files, objectives---all the rational infrastructure---but
no invitation to ask whether the end (restoring bureaucratic order by killing a rogue officer)
is itself defensible. The system \emph{works}; that is its only vindication. When Willard says
``for my sins they gave me one,'' he voices the recognition that he wanted precisely this: to
be absorbed into a rational structure that would relieve him of radical freedom.

Adorno and Horkheimer also analyze the \emph{culture industry}---mass entertainment that
presents itself as liberation but actually standardizes desire and dulls critical consciousness
\parencite{AdornoHorkheimer2002}. The film's Playboy USO show is a textbook case: soldiers
crowd to consume images of pleasure, but the spectacle is pre-scripted, militarized, a reward
for compliant service. Desire is not spontaneous; it is managed. The tragedy is that the
soldiers experience this as fulfillment---they ``get'' the show they wanted---yet the form of
the getting domesticates them further. ``Everyone gets everything he wants'' under such
conditions means: the system reliably supplies what it has already taught you to want.

Kilgore's beach assault, staged to Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries,'' fuses instrumental
violence with aesthetic spectacle. Music that could arrest willing (as Schopenhauer hoped) is
weaponized as soundtrack for domination. Adorno and Horkheimer would read this as the
colonization of art by administration: culture becomes an instrument of power, not a refuge
from it. The horror is not that beauty fails but that it succeeds---the assault is
aesthetically magnificent and morally empty. Fulfillment at this level punishes by exposing
that even the sublime has been conscripted.
