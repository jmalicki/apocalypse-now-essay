\subsection*{III—Beauvoir: Reciprocity as Freedom’s Form}
\label{ssec:iii-beauvoir}
Beauvoir internalizes ethics to the structure of freedom: “To will oneself free is also to will others free” (\parencite[p.~73]{Beauvoir1976}). Authentic projects \emph{open} situations in which others can transcend; efficient means that \emph{close} horizons convict themselves by their very success (\parencite[pp.~134--147, 157--161, 164--173]{Beauvoir1976}). The first clause reports reliable means; the second is the ethical verdict that reciprocity was excluded from the end.
